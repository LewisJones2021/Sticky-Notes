# Sticky-Notes - manage your notes in a simple manor. 

#Following a You-Tube tutorial I re-created a simple notes app.

#Create new notes using the button & save them to the local storage.
 
#Edit a note by clicking on the note and make the changes you wish.

#Delete the note by double clicking on the note. 

#I learnt more about how functions work and a small introcution to use the local storage.
